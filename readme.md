# iBench Community Integration Scenario and Configuration Repository #

This is a public project used as a community repository for configuration files for the iBench metadata generator and integration scenarios in the XML format supported by iBench. This repository is meant to ease sharing of metadata used for evaluating data integration systems.

# Instructions

If you upload your own iBench configuration file or scenario XML document, we kindly ask you to add a section to the bottom of this document describing location and characteristics of the file(s) and potentially its purpose, i.e., what evaluation you were using the generated metadata for.

# Getting Started

You need **iBench** ([https://bitbucket.org/bglavic/ibench](https://bitbucket.org/bglavic/ibench)) to generate metadata and data based on the configuration files in this repository. The tool can also be used to load schemas and data into a Postgres database and validate manually generated scenario XML files.
