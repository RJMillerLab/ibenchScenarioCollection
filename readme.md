# iBench Community Integration Scenario and Configuration Repository #

This is a public project used as a central repository for configuration files for the [https://bitbucket.org/ibencher/ibench](iBench) metadata generator and integration scenarios in the format supported by iBench. This repository is meant to ease sharing of metadata used for evaluating data integration systems.

# Instructions

If you upload your own iBench configuration file or scenario XML document, we kindly ask you to add a section to the bottom of this document describing location and characteristics of the file(s) and potentially its purpose, i.e., what evaluation you were using the generated metadata for.

# Getting Started

You need **iBench** ([https://bitbucket.org/ibencher/ibench](https://bitbucket.org/ibencher/ibench)) to generate metadata and data based on the configuration files in this repository. The tool can also be used to load schemas and data into a Postgres database and validate manually generated scenario XML files.

# Available XML Configuration Files

This is a collection of configuration files that can be used to create scenarios with specific characteristics or can be used as a starting point for creating new configurations.

## Demo Configurations


| Description     | File  |
| :------------ |:-------------:|
| Primitives and Tramp Options      | `demo/primitives-tramp.txt` |
| UDP Person & Address     | `demo/udp-person-address.txt` |
| UDP Flight & Hotel     | `demo/udp-fh.txt` |
| UDP Amalgam     | `demo/udp-amalgam.txt` |
| Ontology Scenario - Target Sharing     | `demo/ontology-target-sharing.txt` |
| Scalability of the iBench Generator     | `demo/scalability.txt` |
| Complete Backup Configuration File     | `demo/backup.txt` |

These are a bunch of configuration files that we use to demonstrate *iBench* features and functionality.

# Available XML Integration Scenarios

This part of the repository contains real world and synthetic integration scenarios that can be used directly for evaluating integration solutions or as user-defined primitives (UDPs) in iBench to be used as part of more complex integration scenarios generated by the system.

## Amalgam ##

**Repository Location:** `realworld/amalgam`

This collection contains some of the schemas of the Amalgam data integration test suite [http://dblab.cs.toronto.edu/~miller/amalgam/](http://dblab.cs.toronto.edu/~miller/amalgam/) and mappings between these schemas.


## Join + Fusion

| Parameter     | Value  |
| :------------ |:-------------:|
| Directoy      | `udp/join_fusion` |
| Includes Instance Data | No |
| UPD-ready | Yes |
| External Description | [http://dblab.cs.toronto.edu/project/iBench/docs/iBench-TR-2015.pdf](http://dblab.cs.toronto.edu/project/iBench/docs/iBench-TR-2015.pdf) |

This integration scenario contains three tables in the source: 

`Person(name,age)`, `Address(occupant,zip)`, `Place(occupant,city)`

where `occupant` in both `Address` and `Place` is a foreign key to `Person` which has PK `name`. These tables are mapped to a single target table:

`LivesAt(name,zip,city)`
