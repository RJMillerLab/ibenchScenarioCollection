# Introduction

This is a public project used as a central repository for configuration files for the [https://bitbucket.org/ibencher/ibench](iBench) metadata generator and integration scenarios in the format supported by iBench. This repository is meant to ease sharing of metadata used for evaluating data integration systems.

# Instructions

If you upload your own iBench configuration file or scenario XML document, we kindly ask you to add a section to the bottom of this document describing the purpose and characteristics of the file and potentially its purpose, i.e., what evaluation you were using the generated metadata for.
